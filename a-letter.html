          To: Falls River Swim Club members and friends
        </p>

        <p>
          It is with great pleasure we announce that Falls River Swim Club LLC is now under new
          ownership by The Greenway Club at Falls River Inc. The Greenway Club is owned by
          Braxton Wilson, Chris Carver and Ben Everhart, who also own Aquatic Management
          Group, the pool management company that has provided pool and lifeguard
          management services for your Club for the last three years. They are starting on day
          one with a solid foundation of years of management experience at your Club.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Club was not being actively marketed for sale when they approached us recently
          expressing an interest. We value and respect the ambition. As some of you may know,
          our family moved back to our home town a couple of years ago. We decided it would be
          in the best interest of our family, the Club and members to restore a renewed and
          reenergized enthusiasm together with local ownership back to your Club.
        </p>

        <p>
          We greatly appreciate and want say thanks for the tremendous feeling of family and
          friendship we have received from so many of you over the last 8 years of ownership.
          We pass on the Club with confidence that as you get to know Braxton, Chris and Ben as
          we have, that the warm sense of family and community at the Club will continue for
          years to come. Without hesitation we can share with you that in our career lifetime we
          would rank Braxton, Chris and Ben up in the top few percent of workers in terms of their
          work ethic, ingenuity, customer focus and commitment to quality. We want you to know
          publicly what we told them privately: We can't wait to see how they develop the Club!
          We simply won't be surprised to hear in the years ahead that your Club has become
          one of the hardest Club's in the region in which to get a membership. We deeply wish to
          hear of their success as well as your continued enjoymnent in the years to come.
        </p>

        <p>
          It has been a pleasure serving you these last 8 years. We are proud of what we have
          accomplished at the pool during our time: reinvesting over $100,000 back into your Club
          while keeping long term member dues rates lower today than a decade ago. We have
          reinvested to replace or upgrade every one of the filtration pumps, slide pump and
          motors (they circulate about 4 billion pounds of water a year); the slide pool has been
          freshly replastered; over 20,000 square feet of pool deck have been resurfaced; most all
          of the pool furniture has been purchased new or reconditioned to like new. And we are
          proud to leave behind one of the only pools in the region to have live bands every
          Friday in the summer, a free-to-use private poolside party area, and a swim team with 6
          Division Championships in the last decade. We wish you all the best in the future.
        </p>

        <p>
          Sincerely
        </p>

        <p>
