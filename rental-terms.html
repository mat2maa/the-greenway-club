      A security deposit is due at the time the contract is signed before the contract is final. If any terms of the
      contract are broken, some or all of the security deposit may be forfeited and responsibility is not limited to the
      amount of the security deposit if the Club incurs damages in excess of the security deposit as a result of the

      CLEAN UP

      Cleanup procedure includes vacuuming the carpet, returning furniture to the original position, wiping and cleaning
      surfaces, as well as any other work required to return the facility to the same condition as it was upon arrival.
      Trash should be taken to the dumpster, located at the corner of the parking lot, near the soccer field.
    </p>

    <p>
      Unless a clean up fee is paid, the facility must be cleaned within the time of this rental contract. If clean-up
      services are purchased on the date of the rental event or if the facility is not fully cleaned prior to the end of
      the rental, a clean-up fee equal to 1½ times the clean-up fee rate will be deducted from the security deposit..

      In compliance with the Wake County noise ordinance, all rentals are required to play any music in moderation, so
      that it does not disturb area residents. If noise complaints are reported, Greenway Swim Club reserves the right
      to end the rental early without refund of rental payment and security deposit. The noise ordinance is strictly
      enforced after 11:00pm. It is the renter's responsibility to make any contracted workers and guests aware of this
      ordinance.
